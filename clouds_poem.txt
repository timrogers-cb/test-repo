Whispers in the Sky

High above in endless blue,
Clouds drift soft and white,
Painting shadows on the earth,
In morning's golden light.

Cotton balls and silver streams,
Dancing with the breeze,
Changing shapes like childhood dreams,
Floating with such ease.

Puffy castles in the air,
Stories yet untold,
Guardians of the atmosphere,
Both gentle and bold.

Rain bearers on their journey long,
Across the vast expanse,
Nature's artists painting strong,
In sky's eternal dance.

Pillows for the weary sun,
Blankets for the moon,
Clouds remind us we are one,
Beneath the sky's sweet tune.
