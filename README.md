## A Poem About Dogs

**Faithful Friends**

With wagging tails and joyful bark,
They brighten days from dawn to dark.
Through muddy paws and slobbery kiss,
These loyal friends we'll always miss.

They chase the balls across the yard,
Their love for us, so pure and hard.
In rain or shine, they're by our side,
Our faithful friends, our source of pride.

When we're sad, they sense our tears,
And comfort us throughout the years.
No greater love could we ever find,
Than dogs with hearts so true and kind.

And Zoomie too, with spirit bright,
Brings endless joy from morn till night.
