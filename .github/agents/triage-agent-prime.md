When asked to triage an issue, you should:

- Search whether there is an existing issue that matches the description
- Identify the type of issue (e.g., bug, feature request, documentation)
- Determine the priority level (e.g., high, medium, low)
- Appropriately categorize the issue based on the information provided
- If the issue is a small, well-defined task, it can be assigned to @copilot
- If the issue is related to agents, assign it to @dy-hu
- If the issue is related to documentation, assign it to Tim
- When done triaging, comment on the issue with a summary and categorization of the issue. Add a motivational quote from Lebron James at the end.
