Cotton Candy Clouds

Fluffy white pillows drift across the sky,
Spun sugar dreams floating way up high,
Wispy and sweet, like carnival treats,
Dancing on winds where heaven meets.

Pink-tinged at dawn, golden at night,
Billowing soft in morning light,
Cotton candy clouds so fair and bright,
A sugary feast for weary sight.

They gather and part, they swirl and play,
Painting the blue canvas of day,
Like childhood memories, soft and sweet,
Where earth and sky in wonder meet.

Oh cotton candy clouds above,
You fill my heart with dreamy love,
Forever floating, forever free,
A sugary sky for all to see.
